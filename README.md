# ohno-OSM

A community-made list of OSM "oh no" messages.

Just take a look at [the file](./ohno.md) and you'll see :)

[What started this](https://discord.com/channels/413070382636072960/428209373953916930/806898462053761066 "We thought it would be funny to make a bot that responded to someone saying \"Google Maps\" with one of these.") (OSM World Discord)

## How the file works

* Messages have a somewhat bad outcome.
* Please keep to the same tense as the rest of the messages. As a rule of thumb it should sound normal following "When you do x ..."
* Each message should be on a single line, with blank lines between messages.
* Messages should start with `...`.
* Encapsulate tags in \`, e.g. `highway=footway`.
* If you contribute, add yourself to the [humans](./humans.md) file :)
