## Contributing info

* Separate entries with two newlines `␤␤`, i.e. there should be a blank line between each entry.
* Encapsulate tags in \`, e.g. `highway=footway`.
* Keyboard shortcuts should use `-` as a delimiter and be in Proper Case, e.g. `Ctrl-Z`. For strings of keys use a space, but keep it within the same \`s, e.g. `Ctrl-A Del`.
* Follow the formatting of the other messages :P
* If you contribute, add yourself to the [humans](./humans.md) file :)

### ohno.md

* Messages have a somewhat bad outcome.
* Please keep to the same tense as the rest of the messages. As a rule of thumb it should sound normal following "When you do xyz, …"
* Each message should preferably be on a single line.
* Messages should start with `…`.
